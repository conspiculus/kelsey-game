- The point of this app is to make a web app that I can send to my friends to
collaborate on writing the story for a short turn based game for my fiances 
birthday. 

- it should keep the same structure as the .html file, but show changes that
others have made. When they go to it for the first time, they should be
prompted to enter their name, and then select a color. The text of all of 
the additions that they make will show in their color. this will be explained 
in the prompt.  

-The users should not be able to delete other users entries, but can 
insert inline text.

-All of the data will be saved when the user clicks save. 

- It should be formatted to be easy to use and understand on a mobile browser.
