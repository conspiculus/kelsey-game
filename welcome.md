Welcome Friend! 

I made this to invite everyone to collaborate on an interactive game 
I'm making for Kelseys Birthday. Its Very simple: Short animations with two
choices that lead to two possible outcomes, eventually leading to two possible 
endings. But I want everyones help to create the story! There are 11 "cards" 
and 22 "choices". The whole thing does not have to make sense at all, 
it's meant to be irreverant and funny. For obvious reasons I'm going with 
a Lord Of the Rings / Fantasy theme here. The story starts with Kelsey in 
the Castle "Eyrie" Starting her journey to the Misty Mountains. The whole
"story tree" will be easier to understand in a browser but will work on
your phone as well. 
Have Fun with it - nothing is off limits lol.
